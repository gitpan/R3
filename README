R3 - Perl client interface to SAP R/3 using RFCSDK

COPYRIGHT

Copyright (c) 1999, Johan Schoen. All rights reserved.

The perl modules R3, R3::rfcapi, R3::conn, R3::func and R3::itab
are free software; you may use, modify and redistribute them
under the same terms as Perl itself.

To use the R3::* modules you also need the RFCSDK which is proprietary
software owned by SAP AG.

INTRODUCTION
============

R3::conn, R3::func and R3::itab provide a object oriented interface
to SAP R/3 remote function calls. The modules needs R3::rfcapi which
provides a Perl interface to RFCSDK.

The R3 module version 0.01 provides no useful functionality.

REQUIREMENTS
============

The R3::* modules requires Perl 5, a C compiler and SAP's RFCSDK.

The RFCSDK is available on the R/3 Frontend CD and/or via ftp
from any of SAP's sapserv. If you have legal access to an R/3 system
you should be able to obtain it - if not, you should not use the
R3::* modules anyway.

INSTALLATION
============

Download and install R3::rfcapi, R3:conn, R3::func and R3::itab in
that order.

To install R3 (which is not really useful) se below. For the
other R3::* modules, see their README file.

On Linux and other UNIX like systems:
	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install
You probably need to execute the last command root.

On NT with VC++:
	D:\R3>perl Makefile.PL
	D:\R3>nmake
	D:\R3>nmake test
	D:\R3>nmake install

On other platforms:
Sorry, I do not know. Please tell me if you do.
